## E-commerce-back-end 

 ## About:
 - A back end for users/managers e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies so that their company can compete with other e-commerce companies.

 ## Description:
 - E-commerce platforms provide a suit of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to the prevalence of these platforms, developers should understand the fundamental architecture of e-commerce sites
 - I have built the back end for an e-commmerce site using a working Express.js API and configuring it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. 
 - I have added a link to a demo below with a walkthrough of the functionality of the backend provided. 
 - The video demonstrates different http methods --such as the GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE methods-- being tested in Postman.
